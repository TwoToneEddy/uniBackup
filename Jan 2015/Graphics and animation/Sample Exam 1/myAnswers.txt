Sets a screen size of 400*400 and colours it yellow in the setup method.
Every time the mouse is pressed it increments an index, if that index is
an even number it sets the fill to green, else it sets it to red. This is
done using the % modulo operator. after each call of mousePressed() it then
draws a square with the starting corner at 1*sq. This as the index I increments
this results in a diagonal line of 10 square with alternating red/green fill
colours on a yellow background. Once 10 squares have been drawn the condi


class Square{
	int cX,cY,side;
	color fillCol;

	Square(int cX,int cY,int side,color fillCol){
		this.cX = cX;
		this.cY = cY;
		this.side = side;
		this.fillCol = fillCol;
	}

	void draw(){
		fill(fillCol);
		rect(cX,cY,side,side);
	}

}

draws a circle with a diameter of 25 at the cooridnate x:400 y:200.

The translate call moves the datum by 400 pixels in X and 200 pixels in Y.
This means the datum (X:0,Y:0) is now in the center of the previously
drawn circle. The rotate() call then rotates the frame of reference by a
multiple of the frame count. Once the frame of reference has been both
translated and rotated an circle of diameter 25 is drawn at X:60 Y:60 from
the new datum. 

Running A followed by B draws a black circle at 400,200 followed by a red
circle with a center on a raduis of 60 pixels away from the black circle 
center. Where about the red circle is drawn on this raduis depends on the 
vaule of the index. As the program runs and the draw() method increments
this index the position of the red circle on the radius increments in a
clockwise direction displaying what looks like an orbit.

Calling the pushMatrix() method pushes the current frame of reference onto
a LIFO data structure called a stack. This means that the state of the frame
of reference at the point pushMatrix() was called can easily be reverted
to by calling popMatrix(). popMatrix() restores the current frame of reference
to the frame of reference stored at the top of the matrix stack.
